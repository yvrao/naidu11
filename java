 am starting a new chapter of my life and I would like all the blessings and good wishes possible. This interview is not about Kalyan Garu or me talking negative about him. This interview is my letting go of my past and my closure. And I would take this opportunity to again sincerely thank everyone who have stood by me and given me the strength to believe that I have a chance at life again 😊🙏🏼
